## Post 3 - On Main Repo!

Code for `StaticFetcher` is on the [main repo](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/pull/5436). Once this is ironed out, reviewed, and finalized, the vast majority of utility/convienence functions should be simple enough to implement as they are REST API based protocols. 

Besides going through review, the only significant part of remaining of the development would be the `DynamicFetcher` as mentioned during Post 1. However, I forsee development time would be much shorter compared to `StaticFetcher`. Much of the code that involved `StaticFetcher` ensuring the registry's i/o is properly handled (which incidently lead to the creation of methods to help faciliate this).

The `DynamicFetcher` wouldn't have the same issue with dealing a persistent file. So, in principle, it should be easier to implement compared to its counterpart.
